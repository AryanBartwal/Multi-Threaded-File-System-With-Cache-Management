## Implementation Files to Create/Modify

### New Files to Add:
```
fs/include/fs/file_operations.hpp     # Advanced file operations
fs/include/fs/compression.hpp         # Compression utilities
fs/include/fs/backup_manager.hpp      # Backup system
fs/include/fs/performance_monitor.hpp # Performance tracking
fs/include/fs/security_manager.hpp    # Security features
network/include/network/file_server.hpp # Network server
gui/web/                              # Web interface files
```

### Existing Files to Enhance:
```
cli/src/main.cpp                      # Add new commands
cache/include/cache/lru_cache.hpp     # Enhanced cache policies
fs/include/fs/filesystem.hpp          # Extended file operations
common/include/common/logger.hpp      # Enhanced logging
storage/include/storage/block_manager.hpp # Compression support
```

## Quick Start Implementation

### 1. Add File Copy Feature (Start Here)
This is the easiest feature to implement first:

```cpp
// In filesystem.hpp
bool copyFile(const std::string& source, const std::string& destination);

// In main.cpp
else if (cmd == "copy-file") {
    if (tokens.size() != 3) {
        std::cout << "Usage: copy-file <source> <destination>" << std::endl;
        continue;
    }
    if (fs->copyFile(tokens[1], tokens[2])) {
        std::cout << "File copied successfully: " << tokens[1] << " -> " << tokens[2] << std::endl;
    }
}
```

### 2. Add Performance Statistics
Track and display cache performance:

```cpp
// In filesystem.hpp
struct PerformanceStats {
    size_t cacheHits{0};
    size_t cacheMisses{0};
    size_t totalReads{0};
    size_t totalWrites{0};
    double avgReadTime{0.0};
    double avgWriteTime{0.0};
};

PerformanceStats getStats() const;
void resetStats();
```

### 3. Add File Search
Implement pattern-based file searching:

```cpp
// In filesystem.hpp
std::vector<std::string> findFiles(const std::string& pattern, const std::string& directory = ".");
```

## Benefits of These Enhancements

1. **Professional Portfolio Project** - Shows enterprise-level features
2. **Performance Optimization** - Demonstrates understanding of system performance
3. **User Experience** - Makes the system actually usable for real scenarios
4. **Technical Depth** - Shows mastery of various CS concepts
5. **Industry Relevance** - Features found in real file systems

## Next Steps

1. Choose 2-3 features from Phase 1 to implement first
2. Create the necessary header files
3. Implement the core functionality
4. Add CLI commands
5. Test thoroughly
6. Document the new features

Would you like me to help implement any of these specific features?
